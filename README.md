#[OfferUp!](http://anteater.offerup.c66.me/)

This project is a location-based app that simplifies the lives of consumers by letting users easily search the online inventory of goods their friends have made available to borrow, while also letting users list their own goods for their friends to borrow.

Users can search by location, by good name/description, or both!

Save money, save garage space, help save the planet!
